## Assignment 6

+ For this assignment I choose the 90s and the 1990s-1, 1990s-7 and 1990s-love graphics. In order to design my webpage, I searched original 90s websites and learned about their main characteristics like; repeated background images, bright colors, black backgrounds and the number of images placed.

+ I choose my color palette because it matches with the graphics used and with the 90s general web design palette. These are the colors:
  + rgb(224, 12, 152)
  + rgb(238, 216, 11)
