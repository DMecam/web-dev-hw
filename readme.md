# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Manuela Elena Cardenas de la Miyar
I have decided to take this class because I am really interested in learning HTML and how to develop a website.

I thought that the following information was really interesting:
+ The ARPANET and the way it was developed.
+ The first message sent using this connection between computers was ''LO'' because the system crashed before finishing the word ''LOGIN''.
+ All the websites are connected in a way that only with a few clicks we can reach any other website.
