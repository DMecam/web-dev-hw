<h3>Traveler, your footprints</h3>
<h4>Antonio Machado</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  Traveler, your footprints<br />
  are the only road, nothing else.<br />
  Traveler, there is no road;<br />
  you make your own path as you walk.<br />
  As you walk, you make your own road,<br />
  and when you look back<br />
  you see the path<br />
  you will never travel again.<br />
  Traveler, there is no road;<br />
  only a ship's wake on the sea.
