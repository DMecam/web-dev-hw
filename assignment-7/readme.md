## Assignment 7

+ For this assignment I choose the Atari text and the Work Sans (Sans serif) and Inconlosata (monospace) fonts for the website. Additionally, I choose as fallback the Montserrat and Space Mono fonts. I wanted to have a monospace and Sans Serif fonts to preserve a bit of the videogame aesthetic.

+ The System Fonts are already installed on the local device or system while the Web Fonts are hosted on the server. The Web-safe Fonts are those that are always available. The importance of having a fallback is that if the main font is not available there's a second font that is similar and can be used instead.
